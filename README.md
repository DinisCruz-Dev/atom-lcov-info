## Atom lcov-info

### What

Displays code coverage information inside Atom based on the information contained in in an LCOV formatted file.

Using the current open file as a starting point, it traverses up the tree until the `coverage/lcov.info` file is found. As an example, while editing `/Users/joe/Projects/xyz/src/client/test.coffee` coverage information could be pulled from either `/Users/joe/Projects/xyz/src/coverage/lcov.info` or `/Users/joe/Projects/xyz/coverage/lcov.info`. (First match as found.)

It supports LCOV information as generated by tools such as Mocha, Karma, Istanbul, and others.

### Why

Some reasons why this package might fit the bill for you -

- There is no additional configuration, your `coverage/lcov.info` file is automatucally located
- Both relative and absolute file paths outputs in the `lcov.info` file are supported
- It does matching irrespective of the platform, i.e. mix-and-match of / and \ style paths are supported
- A summary of the total coverage per line is displayed on the statusbar
- Covered lines and highlighted in green, uncovered lines in red
- Coverage information can be toggled for all views using `ctrl-alt-c`
- Has been tested with Karma, Mocha and Istanbul outputs

### How

Run your tests, generate a `coverage/lcov.info` file, toggle the coverage plugin and it displays.
